Here we go.

The base is dwm-6.2 by suckless.
Patches used:
1. systray
2. focusedontop (to avoid the situation when floating windows are over tiled) - manual intervention was required.
3. pertag (so that each tag can have a separate layout).
4. [Enternotify] = enternotify - removed to avoid "focus follows mouse"
5. Removed parts about xinerama.
6. fancybar - manually applied, to have a list of opened windows on status line.
7. save floats

Manually adjusted the position of the systray to have a possibility to close any window by clicking in the top right corner of the screen. 
The result is: in the top right corner there is a multifunctional button "X-W-Aud". 
Left mouse button will close any focused window. Middle and right buttons will launch a custom program (see config.h)
